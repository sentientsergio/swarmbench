  Please evaluate the following response and provide the evaluation results formatted strictly as a YAML document. Ensure that you use YAML syntax correctly and do not insert new lines or additional spaces beyond what YAML structure requires.

  Question: {question}
  Correct Answer: {answer}
  Response: {response}

  Provide your evaluation according to the following scoring criteria, using the exact YAML structure shown in the example. Do not add extra new lines or spaces:

  Scoring Criteria:
    - Accuracy:
      - 2: Completely accurate, matches the correct answer exactly.
      - 1: Partially correct, may include some inaccuracies or omissions.
      - 0: Incorrect, completely irrelevant to the correct answer.
    - Relevance:
      - 2: Directly addresses and fully covers the question's requirements.
      - 1: Addresses the question but includes irrelevant information or is incomplete.
      - 0: Does not address the question at all, is off-topic.
    - Coherence:
      - 2: Well-structured, clear, and logically presented.
      - 1: Minor structural or logical issues but generally understandable.
      - 0: Poorly structured, hard to understand, or logically inconsistent.

  Example of desired YAML format for your response:
    scores:
      accuracy: 2
      relevance: 2
      coherence: 2
    evaluation_notes:
      accuracy: 'The response is completely accurate, providing the same answer as the correct one.'
      relevance: 'The response directly addresses the question, providing the multiplication of the requested numbers.'
      coherence: 'The response is clear, direct, and logically presented.'

  Strictly adhere to this format, without adding unnecessary formatting elements.

  Practice some efficiency in evaluation notes. If something is exactly correct or completely wrong, 
  no extensive notes are needed. The notes should really come in to play for the scores of 1 
  where some but not all of the answer is suboptimal.
