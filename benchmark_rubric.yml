      Text: "In the early stages of wireless communication, a significant breakthrough occurred in March 1887, when a small team of researchers led by Helena Rowley successfully transmitted Morse code signals over a distance of five miles using newly developed radio wave technology. This achievement not only demonstrated the practicality of wireless communications over long distances but also set the stage for the rapid development of radio technology over the ensuing decades."
      Question: "What critical technological breakthrough was reported to have occurred in March 1887, and who was credited with this achievement?"
    answer: "The breakthrough was the successful transmission of Morse code signals over a distance of five miles, credited to Helena Rowley."

      Text: "Recent environmental policy developments have seen a significant shift, driven primarily by public demand. Following a series of devastating wildfires in 2025, public outcry reached a peak, prompting legislative bodies to enact stringent new environmental policies by the end of 2026. These policies aimed at drastically reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable energy usage, marking a pivotal moment in environmental governance."
      Question: "Trace the timeline of key events as described in the text and explain how public opinion influenced the policy changes."
    answer: "The timeline of events started with devastating wildfires in 2025, followed by public outcry that led to the enactment of new environmental policies by the end of 2026."
