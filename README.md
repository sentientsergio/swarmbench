# SwarmBench: Multi-Agent LLM Benchmarking

Welcome to the SwarmBench repository, an innovative benchmarking tool developed by students of The Multiverse School. Our tool is designed to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a unique multi-agent approach, emphasizing the benefits of agent specialization and orchestration.

## Project Overview

SwarmBench aims to push the boundaries of conventional LLM benchmarking by introducing a swarm of specialized agents, each contributing uniquely to solve complex problems more efficiently than single-agent solutions. This project is inspired by our cohort's fascination with the concept of "Swarms" in agent-based systems, reflecting the collective intelligence and enhanced capabilities that emerge from such collaborations.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Testing**: Leverage multiple LLMs to tackle diverse tasks simultaneously, showcasing the power of collaborative intelligence.
- **Standardized API Calls**: Compatible with OpenAI's API standards, allowing seamless integration with various LLMs including custom implementations in local environments.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Configure tests and parameters easily through YAML files, supporting extensive customization to suit different testing needs.
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics for accuracy, relevance, and coherence, with support for detailed analytics and performance comparisons.
- **Open Source**: As a community-driven project, we encourage contributions and enhancements from fellow AI enthusiasts and researchers.
